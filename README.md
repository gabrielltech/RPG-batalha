Terminal RPG – Turn-Based Combat System

A simple turn-based RPG battle system built in Python, running entirely in the terminal.
The player faces an enemy in a structured combat system featuring attack, defense, and healing mechanics.

🎮 Features

✅ Turn-based combat system

✅ Randomized damage calculation

✅ Defense mechanic with damage reduction

✅ Healing system with maximum HP limit

✅ Random selection of starting player

✅ Battle status display during gameplay

✅ Match history tracking

🧠 Concepts Practiced

This project focuses on strengthening core programming fundamentals:

Data structures (dictionaries and lists)

Functions and logic separation

Control flow (while, if/else)

Random module usage

State management

Rule-based combat simulation

Game loop structure

📂 Current Structure

The project is currently implemented in a single .py file.
Future architectural improvements include:

Code modularization

Character classes (OOP refactor)

Experience and leveling system

Survival mode

Basic enemy AI

Data persistence (file or database)

API integration for external interaction

🎯 Project Purpose

This project is part of a continuous learning process in software development.
The goal is to start simple and progressively evolve the system's architecture, scalability, and complexity.

🚀 Roadmap

 Refactor into modules

 Implement OOP structure

 Add experience and leveling system

 Develop basic enemy AI

 Implement persistent storage

 Expose combat logic via API

📌 Status

Actively evolving project.
